The Mandelbrot Set is defined as all the points on the complex plane which stay bounded (do not tend towards infinity) when plugged into the recursive formula ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20z_n%20%3D%20z_%7Bn-1%7D%5E2%20&plus;%20p) , where p is the starting point. The Generalized Mandelbrot Set (sometimes called the Multibrot Set) is an extension of the Mandelbrot Set, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20z_n%20%3D%20z_%7Bn-1%7D%5Ec%20&plus;%20p) where the power is allowed to be any complex number c, instead of 2. Points in black stay bounded, points in red tend towards infinity fastest.

A complex number can be raised to any number n, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20n%5Cin%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D) , by first changing it from its rectangular form (used in coding), ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%28a&plus;bi%29%5En) , to its polar form, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%28r%28%5Ccos%7B%5Ctheta%7D&plus;i%5Csin%7B%5Ctheta%7D%29%29%5En) , and then to its exponential form, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%28re%5E%7Bi%5Ctheta%7D%29%5En) . The exponent can then be distributed, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20r%5Ene%5E%7Bni%5Ctheta%7D) . It must be brought back to its rectangular form to be used in the code, so it must be transformed to its polar form, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20r%5En%28%5Ccos%7B%28n%5Ctheta%29%7D&plus;i%5Csin%7B%28n%5Ctheta%29%7D%29) , then finally to the rectangular form, ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20r%5En%5Ccos%7B%28n%5Ctheta%29%7D&plus;ir%5En%5Csin%7B%28n%5Ctheta%29%7D) . Recalling ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20r%3D%5Csqrt%5B2%5D%7Ba&plus;b%7D) and ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Ctheta%3D%5Ctan%5E%7B-1%7D%7B%28%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%29%7D) , the final, exact value of ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%28a&plus;bi%29%5En) is found to be ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Cbg_white%20%28%5Csqrt%5B2%5D%7Ba&plus;b%7D%29%5En%5Ccos%7B%28n%5Ctan%5E%7B-1%7D%7B%28%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%29%7D%29%7D&plus;i%28%5Csqrt%5B2%5D%7Ba&plus;b%7D%29%5En%5Csin%7B%28n%5Ctan%5E%7B-1%7D%7B%28%5Cfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%29%7D%29%7D) .

Computation time alone, this took around 170 hours.
Inclding time to write, test, and debug the code, it probably took somewhere close to 190 hours.

I added a few comments where necessary, but that being said, gaze through this code at your own risk :)
