# GeneralizedMandelbrot
Code to create an animation of the generalized mandelbrot set.

2020-2021 CS Independent Study.

Computation time alone, this took around 170 hours.
Inclding time to write, test, and debug the code, it probably took somewhere close to 190 hours.

I added a few comments where necessary, but that being said, gaze through this code at your own risk :)
